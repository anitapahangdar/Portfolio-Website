            <h3 class="heading">Besides <span>Software Engineering</span></h2>
            <p>Beyond my technical pursuits, I've been immersed in the arts for over 8 years, specializing in still life and surrealism with various mediums like graphite, watercolor, acrylic, oil paint, charcoal, and gouache. This creative experience enhances my analytical abilities, enabling me to tackle challenges with unique perspectives.</p>

            <p>In addition to academics, I actively engage in extracurricular activities. My four years of playing the violin have instilled in me a strong sense of discipline and perseverance. My passion for photography earned me a win in a wildlife competition, reflecting my ability to capture and appreciate the beauty of the world.</p>

            <p>As the events coordinator for my school's art club, Iâ€™ve honed my organizational and leadership skills, spearheading initiatives that encourage creativity and collaboration among my peers. I'm proactive, self-driven, and always ready to embrace new challenges.</p>
